# Machine learning

Machine learning is the science of developing algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. Computer systems use machine learning algorithms to process large quantities of historical data and identify data patterns. This allows them to predict outcomes more accurately from a given input data set. For example, data scientists could train a medical application to diagnose cancer from x-ray images by storing millions of scanned images and the corresponding diagnoses.
